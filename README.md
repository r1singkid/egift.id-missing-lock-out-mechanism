# egift.id-missing lock out mechanism


http://www.giftn.id is one of the more popular egift webshops in Indonesia, even big companies like Tokopedi*, Mandir*, BC*, Gra*, and OV* use this site as their e-gift provider. 
I was looking around on their website and comparing prices when I found out that there is a Lock-out Mechanism but its very weak and can be bypassed just by using simple random User Agent and Proxy while using the cURL function.
Its actually only 31 lines of code in the core process, but ofcourse I need to declare cURL function at first.
